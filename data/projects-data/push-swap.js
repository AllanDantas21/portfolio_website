  description1: "The goal of the push_swap project is to sort a stack of integers using two stacks and a specific set of operations. Here's a basic overview of how the project typically works:",
  description2: "Stacks: The project involves two stacks, Stack A and Stack B, initially containing a random set of integers.",
  description3: "Operations: Students are required to implement a set of operations to manipulate the stacks.",
  description4: "Sorting Algorithm: The main challenge is to devise an algorithm that uses these operations to sort Stack A in ascending order while following certain constraints or optimization criteria, such as minimizing the number of operations used.",
  description5: "Constraints: The project typically imposes constraints on the number of operations allowed, aiming for an efficient and optimized sorting algorithm.",
